# board list

Adelia- What if you took vichan, made it one 435 line page of php code, sqlite3, security, and made it to only work with php8.4.8++ ? Well run this board and find out! It's awesome, and makes you wonder why vichan insists on extreme bloat and the largest attack surface possible. Requires an uploads and uploads/thumb dir. The js and css dirs are just demos. You can drop in any  existing vichan js or css !
